                        It is normal for viruses to change and evolve as they spread between people over time. When
                        these changes become significantly different from the original virus, they are known as
                        “variants.” To identify variants, scientists map the genetic material of viruses (known as
                        sequencing) and then look for differences between them to see if they have changed.

                        Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading globally,
                        variants have emerged and been identified in many countries around the world.

                        A variant is considered a variant of interest if it has mutations that are suspected or known to
                        cause significant changes, and is circulating widely (e.g., known to cause many clusters of
                        infected people, or found in many countries). There are many variants of interest that WHO is
                        continuing to monitor in case they become variants of concern.

                        A variant of interest becomes a variant of concern if it is known to spread more easily, cause
                        more severe disease, escape the body’s immune response, change clinical presentation, or
                        decrease effectiveness of known tools – such as public health measures, diagnostics, treatments
                        and vaccines.

                        For the purpose of discussing variants in the media and the public, WHO began using the Greek
                        alphabet in May of 2021 to make it easier for people to keep track of variants without linking
                        their names to the places where they were first identified, as variants can emerge anywhere at
                        any time.

                        In accordance with WHO best practices for naming new diseases, some letters may not be used if
                        they cause confusion in major languages or stigmatize certain groups. These WHO labels do not
                        replace the existing scientific names of the variants, which convey important scientific
                        information to researchers and scientists.

                        from South Africa that the variant has a large number of mutations and has caused a detrimental

                        All variants are different. The Omicron variant has a large number of mutations which may mean
                        the virus acts differently from other variants that are circulating.

                        As of 1 December 2021, there is limited information about Omicron. Studies are ongoing to
                        determine if there is a change in how easily the virus spreads or the severity of disease it
                        causes, and if there are any impacts on protective measures.

                        It will likely take time before there will be clear evidence to determine if there is any change
                        in the transmission of Omicron compared to other variants, how the variant responds to existing
                        therapeutics, or whether infection or re-infection with Omicron causes more or less severe
                        disease.

                        WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of Omicron on vaccine
                        effectiveness. Currently, the Delta variant is dominant worldwide and COVID-19 vaccines are
                        highly effective at protecting you from serious illness and death, including from infection with
                        Delta. Researchers will assess the performance of current vaccines against Omicron and will
                        communicate these findings as soon as they become available.

                        We are still learning about the ways that variants impact vaccination.

                        The data we currently have available show us that COVID-19 vaccines are still very effective at
                        preventing serious illness and death against all of the current variants of concern. It is
                        important to note that the vaccines provide different levels of protection from infection, mild
                        disease, severe disease, hospitalization and death.

                        No vaccine is 100% effective. Even though COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at protecting
                        you against serious illness and death, some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after
                        vaccination. You could also pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated. This makes it
                        very important to continue to practice protective measures, even after you have been fully
                        vaccinated.

                        It is more important than ever to get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn and continue to
                        practice protective measures after vaccination.

                        Viruses are constantly evolving and changing. Every time a virus replicates (makes copies of
                        itself), there is the potential for there to be changes in its structure. Each of these changes
                        is a “mutation.” A virus with one or more mutations is called a “variant” of the original virus.

                        Some mutations can lead to changes in important characteristics of the virus, including
                        characteristics that affect its ability to spread and/or its ability to cause more severe
                        illness and death.
